# Auctions
It is an eBay like E-Commerce auctions site. It will allow users to post their auction listings, 
place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.” 
The user with the highest bid on a listing will win that listing. 
(All these after creating an account and then logging in it.)
