Implement the biding feature 
    Right now when add_bid is trying to get the max_amount
    then it gets max_amount from all the listings.
    Fix it to only get from a specific listing and if that listing 
    doesn't exist then check for default value to add that listing's bid 

Done Above


Right Now when a different user tries to add a new bid on a lisitng 
which already has some bidings of the other user, is showing an error 
of integrity and uniqueness. solve this.
