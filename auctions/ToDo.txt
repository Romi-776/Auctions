To Do 

1. Show the amount of the highest bid yet below the listing to all the users.

2.  If the user is signed in and is the one who created the listing, the user 
    should have the ability to “close” the auction from this page, which makes 
    the highest bidder the winner of the auction and makes the listing no longer 
    active.
    
3.  If a user is signed in on a closed listing page, and the user has won 
    that auction, the page should say so.
